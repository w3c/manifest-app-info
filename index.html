        This document is a registry of supplementary members for the
        [[[appmanifest]]] specification that provide additional metadata to an
        <a>application manifest</a>. This metadata can be used in a digital
        storefront or other surfaces where this web application may be marketed
        or distributed, or to enhance an installation dialog when [=installed
        web application|installing=] a web application.

      <h2>
        Marketable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        As web applications become available via more services (e.g., digital
        storefronts, search results) where they are presented alongside native
        applications, it becomes quite important for them to appear similarly
        to their native counterparts. A web application can define both its
        [=manifest/name=] and [=manifest/icons=] in the manifest, but those
        keys do not provide enough information to help users determine whether
        they might want to install it. Users have become accustomed to being
        offered more details about the applications they consider installing,
        and this document defines additional manifest members that can provide
        that.

      <h2>
        Supplementary manifest members
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following members supplement the members of an [=application
        manifest=]. These members are classified as supplementary because they
        are not [=applied=] to a web application at runtime (i.e., they are
        purely advisory and don't affect how a user agent presents an
        <a>installed web application</a>). All members are all optional and can
        be added at the root of an [=application manifest=], as shown in the
        following example.
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="Using the supplementary members">
      {
        "name": "Donate App",
        "categories": ["fundraising", "donations"],

        "iarc_rating_id": "e84b072d-71b3-4d3e-86ae-31a8ce4e53b7",

        }]
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        As the [=application manifest=] is JSON, the members of this
        specification are of the types <dfn data-cite="ECMA-404#">object</dfn>,
        <dfn data-cite="ECMA-404#">array</dfn>, and <dfn data-cite=
        "ECMA-404#">string</dfn> as defined in [[[ECMA-404]]].

        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn data-dfn-for="manifest" class="export">categories</dfn></code> member is an <a>array</a> of
          <a>strings</a> that describes the application categories to which the
          web application belongs. It is meant as a hint to catalogs or stores
          listing web applications and it is expected that these will make a
          best effort to find appropriate categories (or category) under which
          to list the web application. Like search engines and meta keywords,
          catalogs and stores are not required to honor this hint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manifest authors are encouraged to use lower-case.

        <p>
          The <code><dfn class="export">iarc_rating_id</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a>
          that represents the <a href=
          "https://www.globalratings.com/">International Age Rating Coalition
          (IARC)</a> certification code of the web application. It is intended
          to be used to determine which ages the web application is appropriate
          for.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          An IARC certificate can be obtained via participating storefronts,
          intended to be used for distributing the web app. The
          <a>iarc_rating_id</a> member only takes a single certification code.
          The same code can be shared across participating storefronts, as long
          as the distributed product remains the same (i.e., doesnâ€™t serve
          totally different code paths depending on user agent sniffing and the
          like) and the other storefronts support it.

          represents the distribution platform for which a given screenshot
          applies. Authors are encouraged to only use this member when the
          screenshot is only applicable in a specific context.
        </p>
        <p class="note" title="Platform usage guidance for authors">
          Authors should only use `platform` for instances where a screenshot
          is not representative of a universal experience. For instance, if the
          layout/design differs based on orientation, setting "narrow" or
          "wide" is advisable. Similarly, an OS-specific `platform` designation
          should be reserved for instances where the screenshot includes
          functionality only available on that specific platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents might show as many (or as few) screenshots as they
          choose, but shouldn't display screenshots that do not pertain to
          their platform (e.g., Google Play should not show iOS-specific
          screenshots).
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents can use a screenshotâ€™s aspect ratio
          ({{ImageResource/sizes}}) in determining if the screenshot should be
          displayed.
