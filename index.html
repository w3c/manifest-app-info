        This document is a registry of supplementary members for the
        [[[appmanifest]]] specification that provide additional metadata to an
        <a>application manifest</a>. This metadata can be used in a digital
        storefront or other surfaces where this web application may be marketed
        or distributed, or to enhance an installation dialog when [=installed
        web application|installing=] a web application.

      <h2>
        Marketable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        As web applications become available via more services (e.g., digital
        storefronts, search results) where they are presented alongside native
        applications, it becomes quite important for them to appear similarly
        to their native counterparts. A web application can define both its
        [^name^] and [^icons^] in the manifest, but those keys do not provide
        enough information to help users determine whether they might want to
        install it. Users have become accustomed to being offered more details
        about the applications they consider installing, and this document
        defines additional manifest members that can provide that.

      <h2>
        Supplementary manifest members
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following members supplement the members of an [=application
        manifest=]. These members are classified as supplementary because they
        are not [=applied=] to a web application at runtime (i.e., they are
        purely advisory and don't affect how a user agent presents an
        <a>installed web application</a>). All members are all optional and can
        be added at the root of an [=application manifest=], as shown in the
        following example.
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="Using the supplementary members">
      {
        "name": "Donate App",
        "categories": ["fundraising", "donations"],
        "description": "This app helps you donate to worthy causes.",
        "iarc_rating_id": "e84b072d-71b3-4d3e-86ae-31a8ce4e53b7",
        "screenshots": [{
          "src": "images/screenshot.png",
          "sizes": "800x600",

          "label": "Lots of organizations to donate to"
        }]
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        As the [=application manifest=] is JSON, the members of this
        specification are of the types <dfn data-cite="ECMA-404#">object</dfn>,
        <dfn data-cite="ECMA-404#">array</dfn>, and <dfn data-cite=
        "ECMA-404#">string</dfn> as defined in [[[ECMA-404]]].

        <h3>
          `categories` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>categories</dfn></code> member is an <a>array</a> of
          <a>strings</a> that describes the application categories to which the
          web application belongs. It is meant as a hint to catalogs or stores
          listing web applications and it is expected that these will make a
          best effort to find appropriate categories (or category) under which
          to list the web application. Like search engines and meta keywords,
          catalogs and stores are not required to honor this hint.
        </p>

          Manifest authors are encouraged to use lower-case.

        <p>
          The <code><dfn>iarc_rating_id</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a>
          that represents the <a href=
          "https://www.globalratings.com/">International Age Rating Coalition
          (IARC)</a> certification code of the web application. It is intended
          to be used to determine which ages the web application is appropriate
          for.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          An IARC certificate can be obtained via participating storefronts,
          intended to be used for distributing the web app. The
          <a>iarc_rating_id</a> member only takes a single certification code.
          The same code can be shared across participating storefronts, as long
          as the distributed product remains the same (i.e., doesn’t serve
          totally different code paths depending on user agent sniffing and the
          like) and the other storefronts support it.
        </p>
